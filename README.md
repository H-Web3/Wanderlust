# Major Project phase-1
1. Basic set-up
In this, I init the package.json file then install npm packages; express, ejs and mongoose.
Then create the main file app.js in which require the packages, create a connection with mongoDB through mongoose and finally, start the
server and check it by create a simple api.
Error sol(if you get): As i was working in windows system, i get this error:  
 warning: in the working copy of 'package.json', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it
to solve this error, you have to run this command in your vs code terminal:
 git config --global core.autocrlf true
